# My first experience with some machine learning
First Machine Learning Project - Iris dataset

I followed some tutorials (which I will link later), and had some improvements comparing to the results that I found on the internet.

In my experiment, the best algorithm was the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Later, I will post some good links about this material).
